Appendix.

The license above does not impose any obligations. The license above 
does not prevent one from relicensing public domain software under different 
terms. However laws in some jurisdictions might require one to prove license 
correctness somehow, and thus forcing one to get back to the original license 
containing this appendix. These obligations (if any) do not come from this 
license, but from laws only. This appendix is is present here only to be 
distributed with the license.

Software development cannot stand apart from other other sides of life.
It is a quest towards better society where developers do not have to
put paywalls around their code to be able to eat tomorrow, and other
developers putting anti-paywall licenses to be able to see source code
tomorrow.

Everything is interconnected, so a problem that is connected with other
sides of life needs a solution that is also connected with other sides
of life. That is why this appendix is essential in really solving the
problem. With all the regards to the FSF and other international
organisations like this they are making a mistake by limiting
theirselves to one side of life. They are doomed to be always
defending.
